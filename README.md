# Image-Classification-with-Pre-trained-Keras-models
Understanding the pre-trained models is very important because this forms the basis of transfer learning. one of the most appreciated techniques to perform the classification of a different task thus reducing the training time, the number of iterations, and resource consumption. Learning about the pre-trained models and working hands-on with such models is thus very crucial in deep learning, and the same is the aim of this project.
In this project, we will be using resnet50 which was originally trained to classify the imagenet data. We shall use this model to predict the class of an input image. We shall understand the different steps of preprocessing this input image as required by the network, before predicting the class of the image.
